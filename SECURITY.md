# Security Checklist

## ✅ Database Security - FIXED

### What Was Wrong:

- Database credentials were hardcoded in `package.json`
- Connection string with username/password was visible in Git history
- Anyone with access to the repository could see sensitive credentials

### What's Fixed:

- ✅ Removed hardcoded credentials from `package.json`
- ✅ Scripts now use `dotenv-cli` to load from `.env.local`
- ✅ Added `.env.example` with placeholder values
- ✅ Verified `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Added security warnings to documentation

### Security Best Practices Now Applied:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - All sensitive data in `.env.local` (gitignored)
   - Use `.env.example` as template

2. **Repository Security**:
   - No credentials in committed files
   - Clear documentation about security requirements

3. **Deployment Security**:
   - Vercel automatically handles environment variables
   - Production credentials separate from development

4. **Script Security**:
   - Scripts load environment variables properly
   - No hardcoded connection strings

## Before Committing:

- [ ] Check that `.env.local` is NOT committed
- [ ] Verify no credentials in `package.json`
- [ ] Review `.env.example` has placeholder values only
- [ ] Test all scripts work with environment variables

## For Team Members:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual database credentials
3. Never commit `.env.local` to git
4. Use the provided npm scripts (they handle environment loading)

## Production Deployment:

1. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Use `npm run deploy:production` (no seeding)
3. For initial setup: `npm run deploy:initial` (includes seeding)
4. Monitor for any exposed credentials in logs
